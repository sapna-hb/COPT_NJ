                <h2>Newsflash: You Don’t Need A Referral To See A Physical
                    Therapist!</h2>
                <div class="project-desc">
                    <p>Imagine waking up with pain in your back that becomes
                        worse as the day progresses. When you phone
                        your doctor’s office, you’re told that the next
                        available appointment is three days away! That
                        means you’re in for another three days of pain. If
                        only there was a way to get in touch with
                        someone who could help you sooner!</p>
                    <p>
                        You’re in luck because there is! Every state has
                        approved legislation allowing physical therapists to
                        assess and treat patients without the need for a
                        doctor’s referral.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                <h2>Direct Access Myths</h2>
                <div class="project-desc">
                    <p>Many people believe that Direct Access refers to outpatient physical therapy; however, it also
                        relates to treatment in pediatric facilities, private home care, school districts, hospitals,
                        and sports fields. Direct Access is much more common than the general public realizes.</p>
                    <p>
                        Another popular misconception is that Direct Access is not available in all states. In some
                        form, Direct Access is available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. While the
                        program continues to have some limitations, the foundation was laid, and regulations will be
                        revised in the future to ensure that you receive the care you need when you want it.
                    </p>

                <h2>What to know about health insurance and direct access</h2>
                <div class="project-desc">
                    <p>Although the health insurance sector is continually changing, Direct Access covers a wide range
                        of private health insurance carriers.</p>
                    <p>
                        Medicare will cover the cost of service if the physical therapist sets a treatment plan for the
                        patient. Keep in mind that before beginning treatment, the physical therapist must have the plan
                        of care reviewed and signed off on by a licensed doctor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Direct Access to physical therapy has many benefits. Including but not limited to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Patients reported a higher level of satisfaction when they received physical therapy through
                            Direct Access versus physician referral.</li>
                        <li>
                            Patients receiving physical therapy through direct access versus referral had better
                            outcomes at discharge.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
